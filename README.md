# CWVSmix: Critical Window Variable Selection for Mixtures

This package implements a hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression analysis that combines smoothed variable selection and temporally correlated weight parameters to (i) identify critical windows of exposure to mixtures of time-varying pollutants, (ii) estimate the time-varying relative importance of each individual pollutant and their first order interactions within the mixture, and (iii) quantify the impact of the mixtures on health; and is fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques. Please see the "CWVSmix_Model_Details" and "CWVSmix_Example" folders for more specific information regarding statistical model and package use details, respectively.
